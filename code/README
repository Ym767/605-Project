Please run the installknn.sh to install the package in advance.

R code enable us to apply KNN time series forecast taking parallel jobs as inputs
1. Project.R is the original R code for getting the prediction
2. Project_rate.R(also merge.sh) is the code adding the part the compute the change rate of the prediction. (we do not use it at last)
3. UpdatedProject.R is the code that we make the plots with fewer training data.(the 60th data doesn't have enough data, so we still use the original code for graph)

We used submitnew.sh to submit the job to HPC to finish all 101 stock predictions
